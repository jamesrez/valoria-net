# Valoria Net
The goal of Valoria is to act as a collective, decentralized system that can effectively be used for data storage and realtime networking.

As of now, nodes are able to find and connect to eachother and form organized groups which remain fully in sync while nodes are joining and leaving the network.

## Local Simulation
For local simulation of 100 nodes
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Watch the console logs run the simulation and check out any node's full state by going to it's website (http://localhost:3000/, http://localhost:3001, ...etc.)



## Production Mainnet
For adding a real node to the mainnet in production make sure to set the host's environment variable `URL` to be the public url of your node.
